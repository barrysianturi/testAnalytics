# testAnalytics

These are steps you need to execute to run the program:
1. Install python3. I recommend to install using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Execute `conda activate pymc3_env` in your terminal.
3. Download `testAnalytics.py`.
4. Put the csv file on the same folder as the `testAnalytics.py` file.
5. Go to the terminal. Use cd commands to the directory where you put `testAnalytics.py`.
6. Execute `python3 testAnalytics.py [directory to your csv file] [title of the test]`, for example `python3 testAnalytics.py ./Diagnostic_Test.csv "EMPLOYABILITY SCORE"`.
